**Outline:**

We have implemented a bitcoin mining simulation in Erlang using  the Actor Model. We used SHA256 algorithm to hash and mine bitcoins with the desired number of leading zeros. We have also implemented the Remote Configuration using client and server machines.

## Usage
1. cd the project folder
2. Start erl shell and compile both master and miner using c(master) and c(miner).
3. Run master.erl (Write erl -name master@[your_ip] -setcookie [any_cookie_name]).
4. Run miner.erl (Write erl -name miner@[your_ip] -setcookie [any_cookie_name]).
5. Ignore the warning anf follow the inputs generated by code to start mining.

## Implementation Details

1. To run the program locally, run the master.erl by following the above directions. Then you will be prompted with "Number of 0s to mine:" and "Number of miners to spawn:", fill the desired values and start mining.

2. To run the program on multiple machines start master.erl on one machine and pass 0 in "Number of miners to spawn:", then start miner.erl in other machines by following the usage guidelines you will get a prompt "Enter masters IP address with which you want to connect:", enter the host's IP here to connect and start mining.

**System 1: master.erl**

The master.erl is started prior to the miner.erl with the number of leading zeros (K) and the number of nodes on each system (Miners).
The server spawns Miners (actors) to mine coins and then waits to receive messages either from the spawned actors that a coin is found, which the server will print, or from a client that wishes to participate in the mining.
Upon receiving a message from a client, the server spawns other miners to continuously mine for coins. Any number of clients may connect. These actors on the client behave the same as actors on the server and will send a message to the server when a coin is found.
Each child actor is designed to continue mining until the server finds a total of 100 coins.

**System 2: miner.erl**

Client takes in the server node name as the argument and a connection is established with the server after which the server spawns actors on the client to mine for coins.

## Assignment Details

**1. Work Unit:**

Every child actor is tasked with generating a random string, computing the hash, and mining for bitcoins. Each actor runs until the minimum leading zero condition is satisfied and the generated hash is less than the target value. Upon finding 100 coins, all the actors are killed. We determined that each actor should take on the complete responsibility of generating the string, hashing it, and checking if it's a valid coin. Many miners send the string to each actor for hashing. Like wise, once a hash was found and sent to the server, the check for valid coin was moved to the child actor as the server spent a large number of time verifying each hash generated by these large number of actors. Thus, the child actor now takes all the responsibility and the server only tells the child actor whether to continue mining or not.

**2. Work Unit Metrics:**
we have defined the number of processes to run as = No. of Cores * 4. This ensures that all the cores are used efficiently to mine bitcoins in a faster manner.

**3. Result for 4 leading zeros on 4 miners spawned by server**

**5. Largest coin found (i.e., the coin with the highest number of leading 0's)**

**6. Largest number of working machines**

We were able to run the script on four nodes but the same could be scaled to run on many more. We were able to connect three different machines to mine on 1 server.
